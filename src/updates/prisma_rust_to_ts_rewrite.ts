# 🚀 Prisma ORM is Moving from Rust to TypeScript – Here's What It Means for Developers

Prisma recently announced a major change: they are rewriting the core of their ORM — the query engine — **from Rust to TypeScript**. This isn’t just a refactor. It’s a full-blown architecture shift that changes how Prisma executes queries and integrates into modern JS runtimes like serverless and edge.

In this post, we’ll explore:

- Why Prisma used Rust originally
- Why they’re moving to TypeScript
- What changes in query execution
- How this impacts you as a developer

---

## 🧠 Why Prisma Used Rust in the First Place

When Prisma 2 was being developed, their vision was to support multiple programming languages (TypeScript, Go, Python, etc.). They needed a powerful, portable engine that could generate SQL and handle connection pooling efficiently.

✅ **Rust** was chosen for:

- High performance
- Cross-platform compilation
- Strong safety and concurrency
- Easy to compile into binaries

This Rust-powered engine sat between your Prisma Client and your database, translating Prisma queries into SQL and executing them efficiently.

## 🤔 Why Prisma is Moving Away from Rust

Despite Rust’s benefits, Prisma’s goals have changed. It’s now a **TypeScript-first ORM**. Supporting Rust long-term introduced several challenges:

1. 🔧 **Deployment issues**: Different OS and OpenSSL versions need separate binaries.
2. 💡 **Contribution barrier**: Most of the community works in TypeScript, not Rust.
3. 🌍 **Incompatibility**: Large Rust binaries don’t work well in serverless or edge environments.
4. 📦 **DevX friction**: Debugging across language boundaries (Rust ↔ TS) is tough.

So Prisma is now going all-in on **TypeScript for execution**, and keeping just a small WASM-based query planner from the Rust engine.

---

## 🔄 What’s Changing in Prisma’s Architecture?

### 🔸 Before: Rust Query Engine

In the current architecture:

- Prisma Client passes query → Rust query engine compiles SQL → Executes query → Returns result

Problem? Rust adds binary size, deployment complexity, and limited extensibility.

### 🔹 Now: TypeScript + WASM Query Compiler

The new approach looks like this:

- Prisma Client → WASM (query planner) → TypeScript execution layer → DB → Result

✨ No external binaries.
✨ Native JavaScript execution.
✨ Works with edge runtimes like Cloudflare Workers.

---

## 📦 What About Database Drivers?

Prisma introduced **driver adapters** — they allow Prisma to use JavaScript-only DB drivers (e.g. SQLite, D1, Turso).

So now:

- Query plan is built in WASM.
- Query is executed in TS using native JS drivers.
- No need to serialize data back and forth between Rust and JS.

This simplifies everything.

---

## 🛠 Benefits of the New Architecture

Here's what this move unlocks for developers:

- ✅ Easier deployments (no binaryTargets needed)
- ✅ Full compatibility with edge/serverless runtimes
- ✅ Contributions in TypeScript (not Rust!)
- ✅ Reduced cold starts & faster builds
- ✅ Better support for JS-only DBs like Turso and D1

---

## 🧪 Developer Example: Fewer Binary Hassles

Before:

\`\`\`bash
# Needed to define binaryTargets in schema.prisma
binaryTargets = ["native", "debian-openssl-1.1.x", "linux-musl"]
\`\`\`

Now:

🚫 No more binaryTargets needed.
✅ Prisma CLI fetches WASM package via npm.
✅ Your Prisma project is 100% JavaScript runtime ready.

---

## 💡 What Does This Mean for You?

- You can still use Prisma Client as usual.
- Expect **smaller package sizes**, fewer build errors.
- Soon, even the Prisma CLI may not need binaries!
- You’ll get **edge compatibility** out of the box.

And the best part? No breaking changes (yet).

---

## 🧭 Final Thoughts

Prisma’s rewrite from Rust to TypeScript isn’t just a tech decision — it’s a developer experience win.

✅ Easier contribution  
✅ Faster iteration  
✅ Edge & serverless compatibility  
✅ Simpler install + deploy experience  

If you’re building with TypeScript, this change brings Prisma closer to your stack — and future-proofs your projects.
